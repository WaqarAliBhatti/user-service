/*
Explanation:
NestFactory: A utility class from NestJS used to create and initialize a NestJS application or microservice. The createMicroservice method sets up a microservice instance.

AppModule: The root module of the application. It configures the application by setting up controllers, services, and other providers.

MicroserviceOptions: A TypeScript interface that defines the options for configuring a microservice, including the transport protocol and additional options.

Transport.TCP: Specifies that the microservice will use the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for communication. TCP is a reliable and commonly used protocol for network communication.

app.listen(): This method starts the microservice and makes it active, so it can receive and handle messages. It's an asynchronous method, meaning it returns a promise that resolves when the microservice is fully up and running.

bootstrap() Function: The main entry point for starting the microservice. It creates an instance of the microservice, configures it to use TCP transport, and then starts it.

By calling the bootstrap function, you initialize and start the microservice application, allowing it to communicate with other services or clients over TCP on the specified port.
